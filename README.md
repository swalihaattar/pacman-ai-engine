# AI-Pacman Engine

## Project Title & Objective

**Title:** AI-Powered Pacman Game with Intelligent Pathfinding and Decision-Making

**Objective:**
This project implements a fully functional Pacman game with an intelligent AI system that autonomously navigates the maze, avoids threats, and optimizes pellet collection. The primary goal is to demonstrate the application of artificial intelligence techniques including rule-based systems, feature extraction, and pathfinding algorithms (BFS) in a classic game environment. The project emphasizes clean architecture, modularity, and extensibility for future AI enhancements.

## Dataset Details

### Game Environment

- Grid-based maze structure (tile-based system)
- Default map size: 15x7 tiles (28 pixels per tile)
- Configurable maze layouts using ASCII representation

### Game State Features

- Pacman position (tile coordinates)
- Ghost positions and states (normal/vulnerable)
- Pellet locations (normal and power pellets)
- Distance metrics (Manhattan distance to nearest ghost/pellet)
- Score and game status

### Map Representation

```
Legend:
- '%' = Wall
- '.' = Normal pellet (+10 points)
- 'o' = Power pellet (+25 points)
- 'P' = Pacman spawn point
- 'G' = Ghost spawn point
- ' ' = Empty space
```

### Scoring System

- Normal pellet consumption: +10 points
- Power pellet consumption: +25 points
- Vulnerable ghost eaten: +50 points
- Persistent high score tracking across sessions

## Algorithm / Model Used

### AI Decision-Making Architecture

#### 1. Hybrid Controller System

Hierarchical decision-making with three priority levels:

---

#### **Priority 1: Threat Avoidance (Defensive)**

- Algorithm: Distance-based threat detection with greedy escape
- Trigger: Any normal ghost within 2-tile Manhattan distance
- Method: Evaluates all four directions, selects move that maximizes distance from nearest threat
- Complexity: O(g × 4)

---

#### **Priority 2: Opportunity Pursuit (Offensive)**

- Algorithm: Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Trigger: Vulnerable ghosts detected
- Method: Multi-source BFS + gradient descent
- Complexity: O(w × h)
- Speed boost: movement delay reduced from 0.25s → 0.45s

---

#### **Priority 3: Resource Collection (Default)**

- Algorithm: BFS with safety filtering
- Method:

  1. BFS from all pellets
  2. Remove tiles within 2 tiles of ghosts
  3. Select nearest safe pellet

- Fallback: Random valid move

---

### Feature Extraction System

```python
Features = {
    "min_ghost_dist": int,
    "min_pellet_dist": int,
    "pellet_count": int,
    "ghost_positions": [(x, y)],
    "pacman": (x, y)
}
```

---

### BFS Pathfinding Algorithm

- Multi-source BFS
- Returns optimal distance grid
- Handles pellets + vulnerable ghosts
- O(V + E) complexity
- Ideal for unweighted grid mazes

---

### Ghost AI System

#### Movement Algorithm

- Random valid direction
- No backtracking (no 180° flip)
- No pathfinding (keeps unpredictability)

#### Collision Detection

- Tile collision check
- Swap-collision handling
- Tracks previous tile positions

---
